###Reinforcement learning of AI(neural network) agent @poker game environment with Tensorflow & Python**  

######This project is mainly going to cover the areas of: 
- making good/optimal decisions (building the strategy) with very limited observation
- learning from noisy input with efficient environment (data) representation 
- extracting gradients for high poker variance
- development of network architecture ready for genetic algorithms (Tensorflow implementation)  

There are many similarities to problems like autonomous driving or stock market trading.

######We will implement:
- neural networks @Tensorflow & GPU
- data preparation & processing with Python
- parallel computing with Python Multiprocessing
- genetic algorithms
