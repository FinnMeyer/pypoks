By now simplified poker game algorithm:
- no ante
- constant SB(2), BB(5) and table startCash(500)
- every hand starts with player cash = table.startCash
- 3 players on table
- simplified betting sizes (predefined possible sizes)

Those assumptions imply 4 possible moves: C/F, CLL, B/R, ALL

Table generates hand history (kind of dictionary).
Table player translates table history into player (perspective) history - replaces players with indexes 0..n, where 0 is always self.
