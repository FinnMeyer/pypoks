PYPOKS: reinforcement training of AI agent @poker game environment with TF @python
(solve problem of making good/optimal decisions with very limited observation,
many similarities to autonomous driving or stock market trading)

project objectives:
    1st order:
    - implement reinforcement agent training with TF (@python)
    - high performance training with multiprocessing
    - add genetic algorithm
    2nd order:
    - prepare informational project web page
    - build online demo (game interface for tests/demo)
    - look for supporting entities
    - optional: build HQ classifier for human/AI game decisions

by now I have build:
- simple poker environment and quite fast game algorithm
- simple: random, hardcoded, RNN(LSTM) poker players (deciding algorithms)
- simple reinforcement procedure that works
- simple logging with console + TF.TB

but this is just beginning and there are still a lot of exciting things to do...
